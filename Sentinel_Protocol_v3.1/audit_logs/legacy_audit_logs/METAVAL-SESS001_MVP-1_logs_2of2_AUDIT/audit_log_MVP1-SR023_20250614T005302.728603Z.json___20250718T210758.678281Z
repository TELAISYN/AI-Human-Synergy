The goal is to optimize these queries through AI-Human Synergy under Sentinel Protocol v3.0 to maximize recall and fully capture the 38 studies previously included in the meta-analysis. Outputs will be logged, validated, and compared against previous runs (Harvard and LLM3) to finalize the high-sensitivity engine for MVP-2.5 screening."
