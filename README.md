# AI-Human-Synergy

**Status:** Public Repository  
**Purpose:**  
This repository hosts selected public drops, doctrines, and timestamped artifacts from the Sentinel Protocol ‚Äî a system built to demonstrate reproducible, auditable, human-led AI synergy at scale.

## üîç What‚Äôs Inside

- `DropV1.0/` ‚Äì Public release archive from Phase 1  
  - `hash.txt` ‚Äì SHA256 hash of the V1.0 bundle  
  - `sentinel_protocol_drop_v1.0.zip` ‚Äì Archived memory and audit files  
  - `sentinel_protocol_drop_v1.0.zip.ots` ‚Äì Bitcoin-verifiable OpenTimestamps proof  

- `DropV2.0/` *(coming post-timestamp)*  
  - `DropLog_V2.0.txt`  
  - `README.md`  
  - `V1.0_memory/` ‚Äì Select fragments from original memory core  
  - `proofs/` ‚Äì TXID, `.ots`, and hash documentation

## üß† Why This Matters

Most AI systems produce output that cannot be reproduced, audited, or trusted.  
Sentinel Protocol proves that human oversight + structured memory + AI orchestration can create intelligence that is:

- **Reproducible**  
- **Audit-verifiable**  
- **Immutable via blockchain**

---

## üîê Timestamp Verification

Sentinel Protocol V2.0 will be anchored via Bitcoin timestamping:  
**Date:** 2025-05-02  
**Method:** SHA256 + Bitcoin OP_RETURN and/or OpenTimestamps  
**Hash Target:** `sentinel_protocol_drop_v2.0.zip`

The final TXID and `.ots` proof will be posted here after validation.

## üß© V1.0 Memory Fragments Released

- `C0.1_Origin_of_Trust.md`  
- `C0.3_Ethics_Doctrine.md`  
- `C1.01_Core_Protocols.md`  
- `C1.02_Override_Structure.md`  
- `MemoryIndex.md`

These legacy fragments serve as public insight into the Sentinel memory system that governed Phase 1.
